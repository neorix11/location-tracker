## Strategy
Typically when I start a new Android project I begin with a template such as 
[Android Core Kotlin](https://github.com/neorix11/android-core-kotlin) or [Andriod Core Java](https://github.com/neorix11/android-core-java) which use an MVP pattern. 
However, given the nature of this exercise I decided to avoid the setup and just keep all the code in the Main Activity for easy reference.
